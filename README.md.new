## Features

### Database & Data Management
- ✅ SQLite database with events, categories, and scraping history tables
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of past events before each scrape
- ✅ Prevention of duplicate events using unique event URLs
- ✅ Proper null value handling for missing times/locations
- ✅ Sample data and categories for testing

### Event Scraping
- ✅ Automated event scraping from Olympic College website
- ✅ Multi-page scraping support
- ✅ Detailed event information capture (title, date, time, location, description)

### Basic Analysis & Viewing
- ✅ View 10 soonest upcoming events
- ✅ Events by day of week breakdown
- ✅ Monthly event distribution
- ✅ Time specification statistics

### Enhanced Analysis (AI-Powered)
- ✅ Building Usage Analysis
  - Track events per building
  - Identify most/least used facilities
  - Building utilization patterns
- ✅ Event Pattern Recognition
  - Identify recurring events and their frequency
  - Time block distribution (morning/afternoon/evening)
  - Automatic event type categorization
- ✅ Smart Insights
  - AI-generated analysis of usage patterns
  - Facility utilization assessment
  - Event scheduling optimization suggestions

### Development Tools
- ✅ Database checker for past events and duplicates
- ✅ Comprehensive usage documentation
- ✅ VSCode and Claude integration
- ✅ Efficient development environment setup

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jacob-Pickard/IS330_project.git
   cd IS330_project
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Initialize the database
   ```bash
   python src/database/init_db.py
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Operations
```bash
# Initialize database and scrape events (this will also clean up any past events)
python src/database/init_db.py
python src/scraping/scrape_events.py

# View the 10 soonest upcoming events
python src/scraping/scrape_events.py --view
```

### Analysis Tools
```bash
# Run basic statistical analysis
python src/analysis/basic_analysis.py

# Run enhanced AI-powered analysis
python src/analysis/enhanced_analysis.py
```

### Database Maintenance
```bash
# Check for past events and duplicates in database
python src/database/check_db.py

# Reinitialize database and rescrape all events
rm data/olympic_college.db
python src/database/init_db.py
python src/scraping/scrape_events.py
```
